# VALIDATED-VIV
In this repository, a validated case of two-degree-of-freedom vortex-induced vibrations at Reynolds of 100 and reduced velocity of 6 is presented for OpenFOAM 2206. I tested the case and in its current condition, it should work on OF2206. The reference paper used for validation is given below. I did not find acceptable results using a variable time-step, so I recommend a fixed time-step. I prefer rigidBodyMotion solver over sixDoFRigidBodyMotion solver. Also it is important to take the effects of added mass into condieration when calcualting mass. The added mass effects are not used in finding the spring stiffness using natural frequency formula. In the reference below dimensional natural frequency of the system is fixed at fN=0.166 for all the Reynolds numbers and all the reduced velocities. However, the non-dimensional natural frequency FN differs in each case. Also, the non-dimensioanl mass is m*=10 and structural damping ratio is zero for all the cases.
